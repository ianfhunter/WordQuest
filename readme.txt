== Description ==

What feature is WordPress severely lacking? Goblins. Dragons. This plugin is here to fix that.

Earn experience as you blog. Watch your avatar slowly grow in power with every post.

Complete quests to earn bonus experience by writing about selected categories.

See the visual changes to your avatar as you level up.

Your hero changes class according to your posting style!

OpenSource - Add your own activities for your hero. https://github.com/ianfhunter/WordQuest

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about Feature X? =

If you'd like a feature, put in on the issue tracker and I'll take a look at it. https://github.com/ianfhunter/WordQuest/issues

There are plenty of things you can implement yourself, without much tech knowledge, including additional idle messages and avatar animations. Feel free to email me suggestions if you don't know how to use Github.

= I don't want that category to come up in my quests! =

We'll hopefully address this issue in a later version. Noone gets excited about writing 'Uncategorized' Posts.

= What else are you planning? =

I'm thinking of adding in some graphs and stats to show how your hero has progressed. But we'll have to see how free I am, and how popular the plugin gets.
