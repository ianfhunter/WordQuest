== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about Feature X? =

If you'd like a feature, put in on the issue tracker and I'll take a look at it. https://github.com/ianfhunter/Wordpress-RPG/issues

There are plenty of things you can implement yourself, without much tech knowledge, including additional idle messages and avatar animations. Feel free to email me suggestions if you don't know how to use Github.

= I don't want that category to come up in my quests! =

We'll hopefully address this issue in a later version. Noone gets excited about writing 'Uncategorized' Posts.

= What else are you planning? =

I'm thinking of adding in some graphs and stats to show how your hero has progressed. But we'll have to see how free I am, and how popular the plugin gets.
